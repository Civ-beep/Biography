      <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
      <p>
        <sup>1</sup>I grew up in <strong>Infanta</strong> in Quezon Province, and the town became a big part of who I am.
        <sup>2</sup>I spent all of my childhood there, walking the same streets and seeing the same faces each day.
        <sup>3</sup>I made many friends at a young age, and we stayed close as the years passed.
        <sup>4</sup>We liked to hang out after school when classes ended.
        <sup>5</sup>Sometimes we stayed near the school and talked, and other times we went around town to look for simple fun.
        <sup>6</sup>We also met during weekends when we had more time.
        <sup>7</sup>Fridays felt special because they marked the end of the school week.
        <sup>8</sup>School felt fun because most students came from the same town.
        <sup>9</sup>We often knew each other’s families, which made us feel closer.
        <sup>10</sup>Teachers guided us with <em>simple advice</em> that stayed in my mind.
        <sup>11</sup>I felt safe in that environment because I trusted the people around me.
        <sup>12</sup>Those early years built the base of my character.
        <sup>13</sup>I learned the meaning of <dfn>friendship</dfn> through everyday moments.
        <sup>14</sup>Life felt <i>simple</i> but meaningful.
        <sup>15</sup>Memories from Infanta stayed with me.
        <sup>16</sup>The town felt like one big family.
        <sup>17</sup>Walking home with friends became routine.
        <sup>18</sup>Small moments mattered more than money.
        <sup>19</sup>I learned respect for others.

      <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
      <p>
        <sup>1</sup>My teenage years also took place in <strong>Infanta</strong>, and living in the same town made everything feel familiar.
        <sup>2</sup>I stayed close to my childhood friends, and our bond slowly grew stronger as we matured together.
        <sup>3</sup>As school became harder, we learned how to support each other during stressful days.
        <sup>4</sup>Even with heavier schoolwork, we still made time to meet at least once every week.
        <sup>5</sup>After classes, we walked around town and talked about school problems and family stories.
        <sup>6</sup>We also shared thoughts about teachers, crushes, and things that made us laugh.
        <sup>7</sup>Fridays remained special because they meant rest and time with friends.
        <sup>8</sup>Weekends felt longer and more exciting because we did not rush anything.
        <sup>9</sup>Sometimes we tried new food places, even if they were small and simple.
        <sup>10</sup>School felt more serious, but having friends around made it easier to handle.
        <sup>11</sup>Most students came from the same town, so the campus always felt welcoming.
        <sup>12</sup>Group projects helped us learn teamwork and patience with one another.
        <sup>13</sup>We studied together during exams and explained lessons when someone was confused.
        <sup>14</sup>Teachers encouraged us to do better while understanding our personal struggles.
        <sup>15</sup>I slowly became aware of my strengths and areas I needed to improve.
        <sup>16</sup>I started thinking about what course I might take in college.
        <sup>17</sup>My friends and I talked about dreams and whether we would leave Infanta.
        <sup>18</sup>Some days felt tiring, but shared pressure made things feel lighter.
        <sup>19</sup>Walking home together often turned into moments I still remember.
        <sup>20</sup>My teenage years prepared me for change while keeping me grounded.

      <h2>College Years</h2>
      <p>
        <sup>1</sup>My college life began when I moved from Infanta to <strong>Manila</strong>, and the change felt overwhelming.
        <sup>2</sup>On my first day, I did not know anyone, and everything felt unfamiliar.
        <sup>3</sup>The campus was large, and the hallways were always crowded with students.
        <sup>4</sup>I tried to act calm even though I felt nervous inside.
        <sup>5</sup>The busy streets and loud traffic were very different from my hometown.
        <sup>6</sup>I missed the quiet roads and familiar faces back in Infanta.
        <sup>7</sup>I also missed friends who understood me without much explanation.
        <sup>8</sup>In Manila, I had to start from zero and step out of my comfort zone.
        <sup>9</sup>I pushed myself to talk to classmates and join small groups.
        <sup>10</sup>Over time, I met people who shared similar interests and goals.
        <sup>11</sup>We formed study groups and helped each other with schoolwork.
        <sup>12</sup>Working on projects together helped me feel less alone.
        <sup>13</sup>I learned how to commute on my own and manage my schedule.
        <sup>14</sup>Balancing school, travel, and chores taught me responsibility.
        <sup>15</sup>At first, the new life felt heavy and tiring.
        <sup>16</sup>Each week, I slowly gained confidence in myself.
        <sup>17</sup>Some of my old friends were also studying in Manila.
        <sup>18</sup>We met less often, but every meetup felt special.
        <sup>19</sup>Those moments reminded me of our time in Infanta.
        <sup>20</sup>College taught me how to adapt while staying true to myself.
